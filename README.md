# ðŸš• Sigma Cabs - Taxi Pricing Analysis

Sigma Cabs is an innovative taxi service operating in Hyderabad and Bangalore, offering reliable and efficient transportation for customers. This repository presents the Taxi Pricing Analysis project, designed to predict surge pricing for Sigma Cabs using machine learning models, including **Gradient Boosting Regressor**.

## ðŸ“š Project Overview

This project leverages historical data of Sigma Cabs' trips and customer ratings to create predictive models using **Streamlit** for the web interface, **scikit-learn** for machine learning, and **Plotly** for interactive visualizations. The goal is to help Sigma Cabs provide optimized pricing based on real-time conditions such as trip distance, customer rating, weather, and traffic.

### Key Features:
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile interfaces.
- **Real-time Surge Pricing Prediction**: Predict taxi pricing based on several real-time parameters.
- **AI-Powered Model**: Trained using historical trip data, predicting surge prices using advanced machine learning algorithms.
- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Plotly visualizations for data analysis, such as surge pricing distributions.
